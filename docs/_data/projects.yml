      abstract:
        Capital Bikeshare is very popular and always in demand service. This project predicts the number of bikes to use per hour and have contingencies to fulfill the demand. Various factors such as weather, temperature, working, or non-working hour, the hour of the day are factors to determine the number of bikes.
